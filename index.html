    <div class="container">
      <p>This website features all the work I did for my Music Curation and Analytics Course. I really enjoyed this course as I got to focus on a particular music genre that I find most interesting. This genre is Film Scores. Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by how music can transform the mood of the scene and evoke emotions in the audience. Some of my favourite scores are composed by Hans Zimmer such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Inception, Kung Fu Panda, and The Lion King.</p>
